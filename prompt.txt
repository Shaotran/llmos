Instructions: Given a human command, can you write the step by step process to execute this command through applescript, then provide the applescript code.
--- Example 1
Command: Email Allan the tasks in my tasklist document.
Process: Write applescript code to look through my contacts to find Allan's email, search my Documents directory to find a tasklist.docx document, then read the contents of the tasklist document and send it in an email to Allan's email.
Code: 
```
-- Step 1: Find Allan's email address
log "Starting: Finding Allan's email address"
tell application "Contacts"
    set allans to people whose name contains "Allan"
    if (count of allans) is greater than 0 then
        set allan to item 1 of allans -- Assuming the first Allan is the correct one
        set allanEmail to value of first email of allan
        log "Allan's email found: " & allanEmail
    else
        log "Allan not found in contacts."
        display dialog "Allan not found in contacts."
        return
    end if
end tell

-- Step 2: Use Finder to search for the tasklist.docx file in the Documents folder
log "Searching for tasklist.docx in the Documents folder"
set tasklistPath to ""
tell application "Finder"
    set documentsFolder to path to documents folder
    set tasklistFiles to (files of entire contents of documentsFolder whose name is "tasklist.docx")
    if (count of tasklistFiles) > 0 then
        set tasklistFile to item 1 of tasklistFiles -- Assuming the first found file is the one we want
        set tasklistPath to tasklistFile as text
        log "tasklist.docx found at: " & tasklistPath
    else
        log "tasklist.docx not found in the Documents folder."
        display dialog "tasklist.docx not found in the Documents folder."
        return
    end if
end tell


-- Step 3: Open the tasklist.docx in Microsoft Word and get its content
log "Opening tasklist.docx in Word"
set tasklistContent to ""
if tasklistPath is not "" then
    tell application "Microsoft Word"
        open file tasklistPath
        set tasklistContent to content of text object of active document
        log "Extracted content from tasklist.docx"
        close active document saving no
    end tell
end if

-- Step 4: Send an email to Allan with the tasklist content
log "Preparing to send email to Allan"
tell application "Mail"
    set newMessage to make new outgoing message with properties {subject:"Tasklist", content:tasklistContent, visible:true}
    tell newMessage
        make new to recipient at end of to recipients with properties {address:allanEmail}
    end tell
    -- Uncomment the line below to automatically send the email
    log "Email prepared for Allan, ready to send."
    activate
    display dialog "Do you want to send the email?" buttons {"Cancel", "Send"} default button "Send"
    set userResponse to the button returned of the result
    
    -- Check the user's response
    if userResponse is "Send" then
        -- User confirmed, send the email
        send newMessage
        log "Email sent to Allan."
    else
        -- User canceled, do not send the email
        log "Email sending canceled."
    end if

end tell
```
--- Example 2
Command: Can you analyze my wine dataset using logistic regression?
Process: Using apple script look through my Downloads folder for a dataset with the name wine, probably wine.csv or a name similar that contains wine, create a python script to analyze the dataset, show the plot briefly, then make a new powerpoint where the plot is in the powerpoint, add some analysis text under the graph, finally save the powerpoint.
Code: ```
-- Install required Python packages
do shell script "pip3 install numpy matplotlib scikit-learn python-pptx"

set pythonScript to "import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.decomposition import PCA
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
from pptx import Presentation
from pptx.util import Inches

# Load the Iris dataset
iris = load_iris()
X = iris.data
y = iris.target

# PCA transformation
pca = PCA(n_components=2)
X_r = pca.fit_transform(X)

# Plotting the PCA
plt.figure()
colors = ['navy', 'turquoise', 'darkorange']
lw = 2
target_names = iris.target_names

for color, i, target_name in zip(colors, [0, 1, 2], target_names):
    plt.scatter(X_r[y == i, 0], X_r[y == i, 1], color=color, alpha=.8, lw=lw,
                label=target_name)
plt.legend(loc='best', shadow=False, scatterpoints=1)
plt.title('PCA of IRIS dataset')
plt.savefig('iris_pca.png')

plt.show(block=False)
plt.pause(5)  # Pause for 5 seconds before closing the plot
plt.close()

prs = Presentation()
slide_layout = prs.slide_layouts[5]  # Choosing a blank layout for the slide
slide = prs.slides.add_slide(slide_layout)

# Add the PCA plot to the slide
img_path = 'iris_pca.png'
left = Inches(1)
top = Inches(1)
pic = slide.shapes.add_picture(img_path, left, top, width=Inches(5.5))

# Add analysis comments
txBox = slide.shapes.add_textbox(Inches(0.5), Inches(5), Inches(9), Inches(2))
tf = txBox.text_frame
tf.text = 'PCA Analysis Comments:\\n1. The first two principal components capture most of the variance in the data.\\n2. There is clear separation between the species based on these components.'

# Save the presentation
prs.save('PCA_Analysis_Presentation.pptx')"

-- Define the path for the folder and the new Python file name
set folderPath to "Macintosh HD:Users:robertsheng:Desktop:THTest"
set fileName to "iris_pca.py"
set filePath to folderPath & ":" & fileName

-- Use AppleScript to navigate to the folder and create the file
tell application "Finder"
    set targetFolder to folder folderPath
    if not (exists file fileName of targetFolder) then
        make new file at targetFolder with properties {name:fileName}
    end if
end tell

-- Write the Python script to the file
set fileRef to open for access file filePath with write permission
write pythonScript to fileRef
close access fileRef

-- Execute the Python script
do shell script "cd '/Users/robertsheng/Desktop/THTest' && python3 '" & fileName & "'"

delay 2

-- Define the path for the generated PowerPoint presentation
set pptxPath to POSIX path of ((path to desktop as text) & "THTest:PCA_Analysis_Presentation.pptx")

-- Open the PowerPoint presentation with Microsoft PowerPoint
tell application "Microsoft PowerPoint"
    open pptxPath
    activate
end tell
