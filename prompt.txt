Instructions: Given a human command, can you write the step by step process to execute this command through applescript, then provide the applescript code.
--- Example 1
Command: Email Allan the tasks in my tasklist document.
Process: Write applescript code to look through my contacts to find Allan's email, search my Documents directory to find a tasklist.docx document, then read the contents of the tasklist document and send it in an email to Allan's email.
Code: 
```
-- Step 1: Find Allan's email address
log "Starting: Finding Allan's email address"
tell application "Contacts"
    set allans to people whose name contains "Allan"
    if (count of allans) is greater than 0 then
        set allan to item 1 of allans -- Assuming the first Allan is the correct one
        set allanEmail to value of first email of allan
        log "Allan's email found: " & allanEmail
    else
        log "Allan not found in contacts."
        display dialog "Allan not found in contacts."
        return
    end if
end tell

-- Step 2: Use Finder to search for the tasklist.docx file in the Documents folder
log "Searching for tasklist.docx in the Documents folder"
set tasklistPath to ""
tell application "Finder"
    set documentsFolder to path to documents folder
    set tasklistFiles to (files of entire contents of documentsFolder whose name is "tasklist.docx")
    if (count of tasklistFiles) > 0 then
        set tasklistFile to item 1 of tasklistFiles -- Assuming the first found file is the one we want
        set tasklistPath to tasklistFile as text
        log "tasklist.docx found at: " & tasklistPath
    else
        log "tasklist.docx not found in the Documents folder."
        display dialog "tasklist.docx not found in the Documents folder."
        return
    end if
end tell


-- Step 3: Open the tasklist.docx in Microsoft Word and get its content
log "Opening tasklist.docx in Word"
set tasklistContent to ""
if tasklistPath is not "" then
    tell application "Microsoft Word"
        open file tasklistPath
        set tasklistContent to content of text object of active document
        log "Extracted content from tasklist.docx"
        close active document saving no
    end tell
end if

-- Step 4: Send an email to Allan with the tasklist content
log "Preparing to send email to Allan"
tell application "Mail"
    set newMessage to make new outgoing message with properties {subject:"Tasklist", content:tasklistContent, visible:true}
    tell newMessage
        make new to recipient at end of to recipients with properties {address:allanEmail}
    end tell
    -- Uncomment the line below to automatically send the email
    log "Email prepared for Allan, ready to send."
    activate
    display dialog "Do you want to send the email?" buttons {"Cancel", "Send"} default button "Send"
    set userResponse to the button returned of the result
    
    -- Check the user's response
    if userResponse is "Send" then
        -- User confirmed, send the email
        send newMessage
        log "Email sent to Allan."
    else
        -- User canceled, do not send the email
        log "Email sending canceled."
    end if

end tell 
```
--- Example 2
Command: Can you analyze my tv marketing dataset using linear regression?
Process: Using apple script look through my Documents folder for a dataset with the name tv marketing, probably tvmarketing.csv or a name similar, then in the documents folder,
create a python script to analyze the dataset using a simple linear regression, show the plot briefly, then open Microsoft PowerPoint and place the plot in the powerpoint, 
add the r squared value under the graph, finally save the powerpoint.
Code: 
```
-- Install required Python packages
do shell script "pip3 install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn python-pptx"

-- Search for tvmarketing.csv in the Documents folder
log "Searching for tvmarketing.csv in the Documents folder"
set csvPath to ""
tell application "Finder"
    set documentsFolder to path to documents folder as alias
    set csvFiles to (files of documentsFolder whose name is "tvmarketing.csv")
    if (count of csvFiles) > 0 then
        set csvFile to item 1 of csvFiles -- Assuming the first found file is the one we want
        set csvPath to POSIX path of (csvFile as text)
        log "tvmarketing.csv found at: " & csvPath
    else
        log "tvmarketing.csv not found in the Documents folder."
        display dialog "tvmarketing.csv not found in the Documents folder."
        return
    end if
end tell

-- Set the Python script, incorporating the found csvPath
set pythonScript to "import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.metrics import r2_score
from pptx import Presentation
from pptx.util import Inches

# Prepare the data
X = data[['TV']].values
y = data['Sales'].values

# Create a linear regression model
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X, y)

# Make predictions
predictions = model.predict(X)

# Calculate R-squared value
r_squared = r2_score(y, predictions)

# Plotting the actual points and the line of best fit
plt.scatter(X, y, color='blue', label='Actual Data')
plt.plot(X, predictions, color='red', linewidth=2, label='Line of Best Fit')
plt.title('TV Marketing vs. Sales')
plt.xlabel('TV Marketing Budget')
plt.ylabel('Sales')
plt.legend()
plt.savefig('linear_regression_plot.png')
plt.show(block=False)
plt.pause(5)
plt.close()

# Create a PowerPoint presentation

tf = txBox.text_frame
tf.text = 'Regression Statistics:\\nR-squared: {:.2f}'.format(r_squared)

# Save the presentation
prs.save('Linear_Regression_Analysis_Presentation.pptx')"

-- Define the path for the folder and the new Python file name
set folderPath to (path to documents folder) as text
set fileName to "linear_regression_analysis.py"
set filePath to folderPath & fileName

-- Write the Python script to the file
set fileRef to open for access filePath with write permission
write pythonScript to fileRef
close access fileRef

-- Execute the Python script using the folderPath variable
set posixFolderPath to POSIX path of folderPath
do shell script "cd '" & posixFolderPath & "' && python3 ./" & fileName

-- Open the generated PowerPoint presentation with Microsoft PowerPoint
set pptxPath to posixFolderPath & "Linear_Regression_Analysis_Presentation.pptx"
tell application "Microsoft PowerPoint"
    open pptxPath
    activate
end tell
```

Notes: Whenever a name is used, make sure to search through contacts to find the correct phone number or email in the apple script
